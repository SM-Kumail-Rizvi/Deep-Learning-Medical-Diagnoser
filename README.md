# Deep-Learning-Medical-Diagnoser
Building a deep learning model that will be trained on Patient’s Problems which will be textual data, then our model will give the predicted Disease and will recommend Medicine to treat the patient’s problem as an output.

# Overview
The Medical Diagnoser is a deep learning-based project aimed at diagnosing medical conditions based on textual descriptions of patient problems. The model predicts the disease and recommends appropriate medicine for treatment. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning architectures to analyze patient symptoms and provide accurate medical recommendations.

# Files
medical_diagnoser.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the deep learning model and making predictions.
medical_diagnoser_data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset with patient problem descriptions, corresponding diseases, and recommended prescriptions.
